<h1>Active Directory</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Created a home lab utilizing technologies such as pfSense (Gateway and Firewall), Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller), Kali Linux (Management VM), and Windows 10 Enterprise (Clients) in the VirtualBox. 

**Active Directory User Management**: Designed and implemented a test environment using Active Directory to manage user accounts and permissions. Conducted troubleshooting and resolved account issues.<br>
**Office 365 User Management**: Implemented a test environment using Office 365 to manage user accounts and permissions. Conducted troubleshooting and resolved issues related to email, calendar, and office 365 accounts.<br>
**Windows 10/11 Deployment**: Implemented a Windows 10 deployment strategy in a practice lab using documentation.<br>
**Troubleshooting**:Conducted troubleshooting on various lab projects, including identifying and resolving issues related to networking, operating systems, and applications. Maintained written documentation for future use.<br>

This is a work in progress lab, I will be implementing some hardening practices to address computer security and, moreover, Security VMs (DFIR and SIEM), and vulnerable VMs (Metasploitable and Chronos) will be added to practice networking and security concepts.
